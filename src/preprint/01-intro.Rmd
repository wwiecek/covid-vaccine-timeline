The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health and economies. In the United States and United Kingdom alone, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost in 2020 and 2021. The development and testing of vaccines for Covid-19 progressed at an unprecedented pace, with mass vaccinations beginning in some countries within less than a year from the start of the pandemic.

However, it has been suggested that the vaccines could have been made available even earlier. One proposal for acceleration has been the use of human challenge trials (HCTs) to test for efficacy. HCTs involve intentionally infecting a small group of volunteers with a disease in order to study the efficacy of potential treatments or vaccines. While both ethical and technological barriers to adoption of HCTs are considerable, they have the potential to significantly accelerate the efficacy studies.

In this paper, we aim to quantify the potential benefits of accelerating the approval and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. While we focus on HCTs, the model we use is generic and applicable to all measures that could have led to earlier use of vaccines. 

The potential benefits of accelerating the approval and distribution of vaccines, both in terms of health outcomes and economic impacts, are likely to be significant. In fact, research has suggested that these benefits may be orders of magnitude larger than the costs associated with acceleration (Castillo et al. 2021). Despite this, there has been relatively little research on the impact of speed on vaccination efforts, particularly in terms of epidemiological modeling.

A recent review paper (Więcek, 2022) found only one quantitative estimate of the impact of accelerating testing of vaccines on mortality. This estimate, from Berry et al. (2020), was based on prospective simulations, which overestimated timelines for vaccine field trials and do not have information about the real burden of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. 

We use counterfactual simulations informed by retrospective analysis of data on observed vaccinations, infections, and mortality. This allows us to consider the actual vaccine development timelines. To quantify benefits of speed we consider different acceleration scenarios, estimate the number of vaccinations under each scenario, and then calculate the number of deaths averted, compared to the status quo.

We calculate benefits for two countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. They are large developed countries that were at the front of the queue for vaccine deliveries and therefore would have been likely to benefit from accelerated testing. It's good to contrast these two countries because they had epidemic waves occurring at different times, with different virus strains, and employed different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Epidemiological modeling simplifies many nuances and may not consider certain factors, such as individual behaviors and responses to public health interventions. Therefore, we also include additional calculations, including both a theoretical model and a back-of-the-envelope calculation which ignores epidemiological spillovers. Additionally, we consider some potential unknowns associated with accelerating vaccine approvals, such as (1) less precise information on efficacy or safety, (2) impact on public confidence in vaccines, (3) the potential for production and distribution constraints to nullify the benefits of accelerated testing.
