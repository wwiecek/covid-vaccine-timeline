# Discussion

Overall, using an epidemiological model we find large health benefits from accelerating availability of vaccines, both in the UK and the US. In our main period of interest, from the start of vaccination up to 1 July 2021, these reductions range on average from 1.4 up to 6.7 lives saved per 10,000 people, depending on country and amount of acceleration of vaccination schedule (30-90 days). These are obviously large numbers, corresponding to 45,000-150,000 lives saved in two countries alone in the modelled period or, correspondingly, 15-50% reduction in total death toll from COVID-19 in the modelled periods[^13]. However, our results are uncertain and sensitive to the model, as is typical of epidemiological modelling studies.

[Reiterate model limitations here (they’re already in Intro and earlier sections, some of it also in appendices)]

[Expand into a paragraph: related to model limitations is add a point that the model is very sensitive to excess deaths vs confirmed deaths choice, and these have also changed over time (a lot). More generally, we show that there is a lot of sensitivity in this model.]

Does this large health gain justify investing more into additional trials? Firstly, let's assume that going into Phase II COVID vaccine developers predicted a 33% chance of success[^14]. Secondly, let’s assume a clinical trial innovation has a 6% chance of accelerating approval by 30 days, 3% by 60 days or 1% by 90 days. In expectation this gives 4,600 lives saved in two countries. If implementing this innovation for all leading vaccine candidates cost 100 million USD, that's still about 20,000 USD per life saved, ignoring other health and economic benefits and the fact that a vaccine is a global public good. If we were to factor these in, the benefits would have likely been orders of magnitude larger.

The 100 million cost quoted here is just a rough estimate. Cost of the Pfizer and Moderna trials was ... . The cost of the first human challenge trial in the UK was ... . What is even more uncertain are the probabilities of acceleration that we assumed in the above example (6%, 3%, and 1%). While technically feasible, it's hard to see a clear path to regulatory approval based on a human challenge study alone.

We focus on two illustrative cases, of the UK and the US. Implicit in our approach is the assumption of the first mover advantage, i.e. that the benefits of speed accrue most in countries that can accelerate regulatory approval the most. For that reason, countries with smaller populations also stand to gain more. For larger countries it’s more likely that the manufacturing constraints will bind them, preventing them from reaping all benefits of accelerating vaccine approvals early on.

Any known method of expediting the assessment of vaccine safety and efficacy is obviously not without risks. In the case of human challenge studies [few sentences on HCT ethics]. However, the direct health risks to trial participants are likely low (see e.g. Manheim et al., 2020). We do not quantify health risks to the general population that accelerating approval of less effective or safe vaccines would result in.

# Conclusion (work in progress/TBD)

In conclusion, our epidemiological modeling suggests that accelerating COVID-19 vaccine approvals through clinical trial innovations, such as human challenge studies, could result in significant health benefits, with potentially thousands of lives saved in just a few months. Despite uncertainties in the model and associated costs, the potential benefits of faster vaccine availability may outweigh the risks, especially considering the global public good nature of vaccines. While it is crucial to carefully consider the ethical implications of human challenge studies and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the well-being of trial participants, as well as assessing the potential risks to the general population, our research suggests that potential benefits are very large. 

[^13]: In the period between 1 January and 1 July 2021 there were 61,000 confirmed COVID deaths in the UK and 246,000 in the US (Mathieu et al.).
[^14]: The assumption of 33% chance of success (i.e. probability of regulatory approval, conditional on positive results of Phase 1/2 trials—in case of COVID-19 around May 2020) may be a slightly conservative assumption for COVID, since the vaccine developers were optimistic of approval by the time Phase 2 trials started. However, it is higher than some of the historic probabilities of clinical trial success in vaccine development. (Gouglas et al, 2018)
