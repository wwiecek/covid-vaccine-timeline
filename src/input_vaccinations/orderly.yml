# You must have a script that does something with the data.  This will
# be a single string and the filename must exist when orderly is run.
# The default is to use script.R, and that file (by default) will run
# your Rmd file.  Please edit script.R to contain the correct name of
# your Rmd.
script: script.R

# Optional parameters for the task. Things listed here will be
# available as R variables in your script.  For example:

# You must list at least one artefact that your report will generate.
# Each artefact consists of one or more files.  The format is to list
# the "type" of an artefact (staticgraph, interactivegraph, data,
# report), then below that a description (free text) and then a
# filename as either a single file or an array of files
#
#     artefacts:
#       - staticgraph:
#           description: A graph of things
#           filenames: mygraph.png
#       - report:
#           description: A complex report
#           filenames:
#             - report.html
#             - figures/fig1.png
#             - figures/fig2.png
#
# The example below is suitable for creating a single docx output. If
# you also produce data files or standlone plots declare them as well.
#
# Please update the filename to reflect your filename (typically this
# would be the same as the .Rmd, with the extension changed to .docx)
artefacts:
  - data:
      description: Doses and vaccine platforms for each country
      filenames:
        - vacc_inputs.Rds

# Packages that should be loaded before the script is run.  Use this
# in preference to explicit library() calls in your script because it
# will make it easier to provision containers to run the orderly
# reports.
packages:
  - dplyr
  - tidyr
  - lubridate
  - readr
  - countrycode
  - tidyselect
  - purrr
  - xml2
  - rvest
